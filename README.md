# **FraudLens: A Practical Machine Learning Approach to Credit Card Fraud Detection**  

## **Introduction**  
Credit card fraud is a persistent challenge, costing billions of dollars annually. With the increasing volume of digital transactions, the need for **real-time fraud detection** has never been more critical. This project focuses on building a **practical, hands-on machine learning pipeline** for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions.  

Instead of relying on theoretical analysis, this project adopts a **data-driven approach**, leveraging multiple machine learning algorithms to detect patterns indicative of fraud. The goal is not just to compare models but also to **optimize feature engineering, evaluate real-world performance, and explore practical deployment strategies**.

## **Project Scope**  
This project serves as a **sandbox for experimenting with fraud detection techniques**. The objective is to develop and fine-tune multiple machine learning models while keeping an eye on **scalability and interpretability**—key aspects for real-world adoption in financial systems.  

### **Key Highlights:**  
✔ Hands-on implementation with real-world financial transaction data.  
✔ Model comparison focusing on precision-recall trade-offs (since fraud cases are heavily imbalanced).  
✔ Feature selection strategies for improving detection rates.  
✔ Exploration of real-time fraud detection potential.

## **Dataset**  
The dataset comes from an open-source Kaggle repository, containing **European credit card transactions over two days in 2013**. The dataset consists of **31 features** and **284,808 transactions**, where only **0.172% are fraudulent**—making it a **highly imbalanced classification problem**.

## **Modeling Approach**  
Rather than sticking to a **one-size-fits-all** solution, this project tests multiple approaches:  

1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** – Baseline model to check for similarity-based detection.  
2. **Logistic Regression (LR)** – A simple but interpretable model for fraud classification.  
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** – Effective for handling imbalanced data distributions.  
4. **Decision Tree (DT)** – Fast and interpretable, often used for fraud detection in practice.  

Each model will be evaluated based on:  
- **Precision & Recall:** Since false positives are tolerable but false negatives (missed frauds) are costly.  
- **F1-Score:** A balanced metric for imbalanced datasets.  
- **Computation Time:** Important for real-time fraud detection feasibility.

## **Implementation Strategy**  
### **1️⃣ Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**  
✔ Handling missing values and data anomalies.  
✔ Feature scaling and transformation for improved model performance.  
✔ Balancing the dataset with **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** to improve fraud detection.  

### **2️⃣ Model Training & Evaluation**  
✔ Splitting dataset into **train-test-validation** for robust performance testing.  
✔ Hyperparameter tuning using **GridSearchCV** to optimize each model.  
✔ Evaluating **precision, recall, and AUC-ROC curves** to determine the best model.  

### **3️⃣ Optimization & Real-World Considerations**  
✔ Experimenting with ensemble techniques (e.g., **Random Forest, XGBoost**).  
✔ Exploring **real-time fraud detection feasibility** with batch vs. streaming methods.  
✔ Considering interpretability using **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** for understanding fraud triggers.
